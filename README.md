## About Me
Following a breast cancer diagnosis at 32, I have undergone breast conserving surgery with full axillary lymph node clearance. 
Prior to surgery I managed successful fertility preservation.

Following surgery I am undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and hormone therapy.
